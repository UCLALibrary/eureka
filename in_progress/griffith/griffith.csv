In 1882, he purchased Los Feliz Rancho near Los Angeles, and acquired extensive real estate in the city. In 1896, he donated most of his ranch to the city for a public park, and in 1912 provided money for the construction of an astronomical observatory on Mt. Hollywood. His son, Van Griffith, became president of the Los Angeles Park Board, and was manager of the Griffith Park Transportation Company. He was also a member of the Los Angeles Police Commission and an ombudsman for Mayor Fletcher Bowron. His wife, Constance Griffith, served on the Los Angeles board of directors of the League of Women Voters and on the state board. The collection contains manuscripts, documents, photographs, glass negatives, newspapers, maps, clippings, magazines, books, and miscellaneous memorabilia of the Griffith family, including Griffith J. Griffith, his son Van, and Van's wife, Constance Griffith, including material in the Citizens Research Institute, the Los Angeles city police commission, the Griffith Trust Fund, and the League of Women Voters.","1845/1973","","http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt4199q2rv","https://catalog.library.ucla.edu/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=4233097","Griffith Family Papers","","","https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/collections/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz0008hj24"
