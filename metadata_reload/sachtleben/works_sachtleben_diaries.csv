(143 pages),"William Lewis Sachtleben was an American long-distance cyclist who rode across Asia from Istanbul to Peking in 1891 to 1892 with Thomas Gaskell Allen Jr. The diary of notebook “No. 10” covers a portion of their journey through the Armenian area of Turkey from April 12 to May 9 (there is a 2-page reading list at the end). During this time they rode from Ankara (Angora in the diary) to Sivas, where they stayed for ten days while Allen had a bout of typhoid fever, and the first half of a ten-day excursion to Merzifon (Mersovan in the diary), taken by Sachtleben to give Allen additional time to recover. The towns Sachtleben stayed in during this period include Ankara, Kayseri (Caesarea), Sivas, Tocat, Amasya and Merzifon. Up to this time, European and Asian travel had been restricted to the wealthy, aided by escorts and translators. This diary documents a new mode of generally unassisted, economical travel into areas of Asia not traversed by Westerners. Sachtleben provides richly detailed descriptions of a variety of aspects of the bicycle journey including the countryside, the villages along the way, the khans (inns), the towns he stayed in, the food that he ate, the various people he encountered and stayed with and the reactions of locals to the spectacle of foreigners on bicycles. Sachtleben comments more than once upon the conversational skills of his acquaintances, and many conversations, and some stories, are recounted at length.",1891-04-12/1891-05-09,Turkey,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz002hjqt1/manifest

From Corinth to Athens, Jan. 3, 1891 to Feb. 5, 1891","January 3, 1891-February 5, 1891",1 v. (173 pages),"William Lewis Sachtleben was an American long-distance cyclist who rode across Asia from Istanbul to Peking in 1891 to 1892 with Thomas Gaskell Allen Jr. The diary of “Notebook No. 7” covers the period from January 3, when he and Allen cycled into Athens from Corinth, to February 5, the day Allen left for London to collect two new bicycles for the Asian portion of their journey. The diary records Sachtleben’s attention-attracting navigation of Athens by bicycle to major archeological sites; during one ride he witnessed, by chance, the funeral procession of Heinrich Schliemann, the German archeologist and excavator of Troy. The diary also recounts his visits to consular officials to make arrangements for his Asian journey, including Archibald Loudon Snowden, United States minister to Greece, and James Irving Manatt, the United States Consul in Athens. Much of the diary is occupied with recording day-to-day activities, encounters and friendships formed in Athens, the most important being with Basilios Kapsambelis, a member of a wealthy Piraeus family, and Serope Armenag Gurdjian. Gurdjian was an Armenian from Talass, Kayseri, Turkey who had graduated from New Hampton Literary and Theological Institution (Vermont) and Bowdoin College, had become a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1874 and had returned to Istanbul to work and found a school with sponsorship from wealthy Americans. Earlier that winter, Gurdjian had been detained in Istanbul on suspicion of participating in a revolutionary committee and making a seal for the committee. He was released on the basis of his American citizenship. Several conversations with Gurdjian are recorded in the diary and they include substantial biographical information. It appears that his friendship with Gurdjian was the catalyst for his decision to continue his cycling adventure across Turkey and Iran instead of some other possible but less challenging route.",1891-01-03/1891-02-05,Greece,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz002hjqvj/manifest
