The impetus for SOUL was the Watts Riots, which inspired local newsman Ken Jones to develop a vehicle for documenting and expressing the African American perspective in a self-representative way. Equipped with his vision and the industrious drive of his wife, Regina Jones, the company initially focused on providing promotion and recognition for Black musicians, who received scant publicity at that time. Its publications grew to include other aspects of Black cultural production, including film, television, literature, and the visual arts.","","","","","SOUL Magazine was the principal publication of SOUL Publications, Inc., a Los Angeles-based enterprise founded by Regina and Ken Jones in 1966. Initially established to engender greater visibility for Black artists in the music industry, SOUL ultimately provided a space for critical engagement with Black artistic expression as well as social issues. The collection includes newspaper and magazine issues, research and clipping files on artists and public figures, audio cassettes of interviews and performances, photographs, and administrative files.","","","",""
