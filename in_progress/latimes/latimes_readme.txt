The LA Times Collection is being migrated by Lisa McAulay with assistance from Geno Sanchez. The first major ingest of this collection was performed in December 2019 and March and April 2020. 

The collection is continuing to be described in the metadata section of the Resource Acquisition and Metadata Services department (RAMS). 

The collection is divided into several CSVs because it is so large and the prcoesses related to Bucketeer, Fester, and Californica cannot handle more than 3,000 items at a time. I can't remember the details. 

In February 2021, we are trying to re-ingest the collection because we have an error in the collection name. It is showing us that there are some errors in the metadata that are now incompatible with Californica. 

The main error is non-conformance to ISO8601 in the date.normalized field, which the Californica Solr now uses for date sorting.
