It is not only the best remedy ever known for Bruises, Cuts, Burns, &c., but for Dysentery, or Cholera, or any sort of bowel complaint, it is a remedy unsurpassed for efficiency, and rapidity of action. In the great cities of India, and other hot climates, it has become the standard medicine for all such complaints, as well as for Dyspepsia, Liver Complaints, and other kindred disorders. For Coughs and Colds, Canker, Asthma, and Rheumatic difficulties, it has been proved by the most abundant and convincing testimony to be an invaluable medicine...It has effected cures in diarrhoea; and for cuts and bruises it is invaluable...Known almost universally to be a good remedy for burns, and other pains of the body; and is valuable not only for colds in winter, but for various summer complaints...The stain occasioned by external application of the Pain Killer is easily removed by washing in alcohol...For a Cold. Take a teaspoonful of Pain Killer in half a cupful of hot water, well sweetened with molasses or sugar, just before going to bed, bathing the chest freely in the Pain Killer at the same time...For a Cough...For Bronchitis. Take two teaspoonfuls of the Cough Mixture three times a day, using as a gargle for the throat, every night and morning, a strong mixture of Pain Killer in water, or milk and water, sweetened with loaf-sugar...For Asthma and Croup...For Kidney Complaints...If troubled with retention of urine, take one or two pills of Venice turpentine, in addition to the above, till relieved. For Sick-Headace and Sea-Sickeness...For Cramp and Pain in the Stomach...Painter's Colic...For Dyspepsia...Acid Stomach, Heartburn, Indigestion, Liver Complaint, Rheumatism, may be treated the same as Dyspepsia.

Take teaspoonful of the Pain Killer, well mixed in a gill of hot milk and molasses, or with a tablespoonful of castor oil...For Cholera...For Sprains and Bruises...For Toothache...For Scalds, Burns, Frost Bites, and Old Sores. Keep the wounded parts wet with the Pain Killer till the pain ceases: and then, to heal the wound, use a salve made of equal parts, rosin, beeswax, and sweet oil, mixed by simmering over a slow fire. For Chilblains, Erysipelas, Ringworms, Whitlows, and Boils...For Headache and Neuralgia in the Face or Head, as well as for Sciatica, Rheumatism, Gout, or Pains in the Side, Back and Loins...The Pain Killer may sometimes be taken with good effect in smaller doses than here prescribed; and, as it contains no poisonous ingredient, if an overdose should at any time be taken, no unfavorable or injurious results can follow...",,,,,,1 print (trade card),,,,,,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz0015s7vd/manifest
