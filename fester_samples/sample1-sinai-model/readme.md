Sample 1 for Fester: Sinai manuscripts model

For the Sinai manuscripts project, CSVs will follow the model below:

``
`batch1` (this folder contains all the CSVs for a specific batch, always one `works.csv` file and a CSV for each manuscript with page rows only.)
-- `works.csv` (this csv includes rows for all the **Work** rows in a batch, the first batch in a project will likely also have a **Collection** row)
-- `hathaway1.csv` (this csv contains all **ChildWork** rows for a given mss in `works.csv`)
-- `hathaway2.csv` (this csv contains all **ChildWork** rows for a given mss in `works.csv`)
-- `hathaway3.csv` (this csv contains all **ChildWork** rows for a given mss in `works.csv`)
-- `hathaway4.csv` (this csv contains all **ChildWork** rows for a given mss in `works.csv`)
