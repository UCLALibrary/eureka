1. `minasian_digitized_works_updated_2020_05_20.csv` was created by Ashton to take all the intellectual works titles from the hierarchy in DLCS and put it into a column for the manuscript volume. She did this work on 2020-05-20.

2. using the `minasian_digitized_works_updated_2020_05_20` select manuscript rows for ingest and cut the rows and put them in `minasian_digitized_works_ingested_2020_05_20`

3. gradually, the first file will have fewer rows and the second file will have more rows. The first file will be rows for manuscript ("works" in californica) to be migrated and the second file will be manuscripts that have been migrated.
