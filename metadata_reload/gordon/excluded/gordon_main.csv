Gordon, Jr./William C. Beverly, Jr. Collection","The approximately 800 photographs in this collection represent the lifelong interest of Los Angeles African American attorney, Walter L. Gordon, in documenting little known aspects of African American history and culture through the first half the 20th century. Los Angeles and the legal profession were plagued by racial discrimination, but these photographs display a range of people, places and institutions who successfully defied society’s limited expectations. Materials include photographs given to Mr. Gordon by California Eagle newspaper publisher Charlotta Bass;  photos Mr. Gordon collected of images of black resorts such as Val Verde; well-known political figures;  sophisticated night life and social club functions; performing artists such as Count Basie, Louis Armstrong and Billie Holiday. Mr. Gordon established his law practice in 1936; he retired in 2004, after nearly seventy years practicing law. In 2002, the entire collection was given to William C. Beverly, Jr., who loaned them to Eighth & Wall (an organization promoting the preservation of the history of the African American community of Los Angeles). In 2010, the collection was donated to UCLA.

When the Rams moved to Los Angeles, they applied to lease the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Harding made a moving speech at the Coliseum Commission's hearing, arguing that since black tax dollars helped build and maintain the Coliseum, none of its tenants should be allowed to discriminate. He also summarized the contributions of black athletes who had played in the NFL before an unwritten color ban was instituted in 1933, and spoke of the sacrifices of African American soldiers in World War II.

But he was a very young man when he started and he was in his 20s. To retire from the Post Office in those days you had to go to a certain age. He was still in his 20s and he'd been with them a gang of years. It was regarded as a good job because he was a mounted carrier, had to take care of his horse and all that. But he then went into the real estate business, and he also started peddling those papers I told you about. Along the way, he finally got himself an office at Adams and Central (Adams and Central would be 26th and Central). There's a lovely shack of a building there, and he moved in there. He's sitting in this old office back there, these in the 20s. And that's my father's original first office. That's him in the back.This man's name is E. J. Porter. E. J.
