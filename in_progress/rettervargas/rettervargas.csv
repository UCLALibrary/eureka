This rich photographic resource consists of six “orphan” collections that were collected at swapmeets and flea markets by the CSRC's previous Librarian and Archivist, Yolanda Retter-Vargas. Although it is unknown who these photographs belonged to, these collections appear to have been gathered by six different families. The photographs document the day-to-day activities of Latino families living in Los Angeles from the early 1900s through the 1990s. One of the project’s goals is to provide the opportunity for community members to contribute additional information about the photographs for the archival record.
