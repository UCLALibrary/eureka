He began working in the film industry in the 1930s as a researcher, film editor, and writer, eventually working his way up to the position of associate producer by the early 1940s. Following World War II, he formed an independent motion picture company and produced modest-budget films. In 1951, he brought his company as an autonomous unit under the banner of Columbia Pictures. After 1955, Kramer directed and produced films receiving numerous awards and Academy Award nominations. The collection contains production files for Kramer's films, stills, scripts, audio tapes, ephemera, related correspondence, and memorabilia.","","1945-1984","https://catalog.library.ucla.edu/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=1973028","https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/ft2x0nb09b/","","","https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/collections/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz001nx6gt"
