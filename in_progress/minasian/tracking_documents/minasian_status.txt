Reviewing Table of Contents presentation on Item Detail Page 


Batch 10

Needs Geno's help to add a placeholder image to the Masters for Manuscript 151. Then Manuscript 151 has to be re-bucketeered and then I have to re-do festering.

Turns out Manuscript 151 does not contain any conceptual works. Ashton's script picked up a page object item and interpreted it as a conceptual work because it didn't have a tiff image associated with it. But it was not a work, it was a page that was not imaged. 

Batch 11 

needs me to gather up the pages csvs.
