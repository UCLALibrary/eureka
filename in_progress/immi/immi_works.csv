Manuscript. 18 [Herbarium Apuleii and other works].,"Produced in Lombardy about 1400, Yale Medical Library Ms. 18 is a late illustrated example of a very traditional herbal, a group of texts sometimes called the Herbarius complex, the origins of which go back to the 4th century.  It became the most widely used of all anthologies on materia medica available in the early Middle Ages. One of the texts, ""Ex herbis feminis,"" based on Dioscorides, was illustrated at least as early as the sixth century, judging from the admonition of  Cassiodorus ""if you do not have sufficient facility reading Greek, then you can turn to the herbal of Dioscorides, which describes and draws the herbs of the field with wonderful  faithfulness."" (The original work of Dioscorides was, of course in Greek and not illustrated.)  That work, the Herbarius of Pseudo-Apuleius, which gives its name to the complex, and the Liber medicinae ex animalibus et avibus attributed to Sextus Placitus, contain the bulk of the illustrations.  These consist mostly of plant and animal portraits, bold and attractively tinted, but also include several authorial portraits, a few harvesting scenes, consultation scenes, and cityscapes. In addition, some interesting mythological scenes appear in the Precationes (Precatio terrae and Precatio omnium herbarum), lightly Christianized pagan prayers to the powers of the earth and of its herbs.

Manuscript. 28 [Paneth codex].,"Completed in Bologna in 1326, the Paneth codex is a large heavy volume, likely used as a university reference book. It contains 42 medical tracts by both classical and contemporary authorities, including Hippocrates, Galen, and Rhazes (Ra?zi?, Abu? Bakr Muhòammad ibn Zakari?ya?, 865?-925?). Veterinary medicine is addressed in works on falconry and the care of horses. The subject of surgery dominates, with more than one quarter of the manuscript devoted to four surgical tracts including one by Albucasis (Abu? Al-Qa?sim Khalaf ibn Abba?s al-Zahra?wi?, d. 1013?),which is illustrated with images of surgical instruments. Nearly 50 miniatures and illustrated initials depict scenes of instruction, physicians attending the sick and bedridden, and medical practices including taking the pulse, bloodletting, uroscopy, and head surgery. Detailed and colorful marginalia include geometric patterns and anthropomorphic figures that appear sometimes to comment humorously on the subjects of the miniatures and initials.
