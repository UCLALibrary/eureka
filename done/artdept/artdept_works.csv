It is both a vehicle and part of the territory to which it might travel.  A radio broadcasts the log of a ship at sea.The room undergoes the climactic changes noted in the log, written by a character from an unfinished novel by Edgar Allan Poe.A topographical operation that transforms the voyage into territory.Act 2:  A nameless mountain whose topography produces music synchronised with a play of light.  A music box composing concerts for penguins.Act 3.  A stage for the performance of the preceding acts. a skating rink of black ice waiting for representation of the event and its program in three acts."
