The sheet of glass was placed horizontally and leaned against the wall at  a 45 degree angle, the clock was running at the correct time.  I entered the room and reset the clock to twelve midnight.  I crawled into the space between the glass and the wall, and lay on my back.  I was prepared to lie in this position indefinitely, until one of the three elements was disturbed or altered.  The piece ended when Dennis O'Shea placed a container of water inside the space between the wall and the glass, 48 hours and 10 minutes after the start of the piece.  I immediately for up and smashed the face of the clock with a hammer, recording the exact amount of time which had elapsed from beginning to end.- Chris Burden"

A record is played during the performance of music that is normally used in films to create the sense of action, drama and tension.  Because of what the music connotes, an ambiguity is set up by the combination of theatrical sound and formal image: Whether or not it is an athletic exercise or a staged dual (theatre), a competition for points, or for life and death."

Rousingly loud Prussian marching music, lasting 4 to 5 minutes, gives way to a fanfare of bugles which heralds the appearance of two professional boxers dressed identically in white.  The bout is fought in silence and illuminated by a white strobe light.  When one boxer is knocked out, a red light comes on and the two figures freeze.  The performance ends here with a repetition of the martial music played at a lower volume."
