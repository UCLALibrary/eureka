Each flask is attached by a line to a balloon of text inscribed with a summary of the state of digestion and often the prognosis. The captions of the two flasks which face each other at 12 o'clock, for example, read ""reddish color of urine, or beautiful gold"" and ""pinkish color of urine, or oriental crocus."" The ""balloon"" to which the left flask is attached reads ""These two urines signify completion of digestion, while the right one belongs to a group linked to a ""balloon"" reading ""these four urines signify exessive digestion.""  In contrast to these relatively favorable prognoses, the dark colored jordans at five o'clock are linked to a balloon reading, ""these urines signify death.""
