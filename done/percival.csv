It is the oldest continuously operating parish and the oldest stone building in California. It is the only existing presidio chapel in California and the only existing building in the original Monterey Presidio. The church was founded by the Franciscan Father Junípero Serra as the chapel of Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo on June 3, 1770. Father Serra first established the original mission in Monterey at this location on June 3, 1770, near the native village of Tamo. However, Father Serra became engaged in a power struggle with Military Governor Pedro Fages, who was headquartered at the Presidio of Monterey. Serra relocated the mission to its current location in the present-day town of Carmel.
