Advanced Research Projects Agency|~|ARPANET (Computer network)","Michael Allen Wingfield Papers, 1969-1982","Michael Allen Wingfield Papers|~|Wingfield (Michael) Collection","Michael Allen Wingfield, former UCLA engineering graduate student, was part of a team responsible for installing the Interface Message Processor (IMP) and creating the first Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) node at the University of California, Los Angeles. He designed the hardware interface linking the Scientific Data Systems (SDS) Sigma 7 computer at UCLA with an IMP to connect to the ARPANET in 1969, making UCLA the first site to receive an IMP. He also implemented Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) for Unix, a family of multiuser computer operating systems, in 1979. His papers detail the design specifications of the IMP for ARPANET and the TCP/IP source code for UNIX, and include: handwritten notes, manuals, specifications, computer printouts, and photographs.","In June of 1969, Michael Allen Wingfield, an engineering graduate student, was asked by Steve Crocker at UCLA to design the hardware interface between the Scientific Data Systems (SDS) Sigma 7 computer and an Interface Message Processor (IMP) from Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN) to connect the UCLA system as the first node on the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), the precursor to the internet. After reviewing the BBN 1822 IMP interface specification, Wingfield drew up flow charts, logic diagrams, and a test program for the IMP when it was received from BBN in September 1969.","Collection 2327","1969-1982","1969/1982","https://catalog.library.ucla.edu/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=8133227","https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c8t1592t/","","","https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/collections/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz002gvzqg"
