Batches 1-10

Reviewing Table of Contents presentation on Item Detail Page 
All manuscripts could be better structured to have correct "two up" view. Right now the display is usually off because the preliminary images don't match the expected order for a "book object". 

Batch 11 

Prepping Batch 11. Buckeer has happened, but more needed.  Now need to fix a few individual items. A Jira ticket for bucketeering batch 11 has been created and I'm talking to Dawn and Geno about Jake's availability to do that work. (Lisa, 9/30/20)
