Batches 1-9

Reviewing Table of Contents presentation on Item Detail Page 

Batch 9

Loading onto stage 9/30.
Discovered that Manuscript 62 had a page item that didn't have an image attached to it. So I needed to find the image, add a row to the pages.csv. Now I'm stuck on rebucketering it. (9/30/20)
I have checked the metadata for all the manuscripts on californica-stage. So I'm ready to re-festerize and reload and then move to production as soon as I can get the bucketed situation unblocked


Batch 10

Proofed on Stage on 9/29. Ingesting to production on 9/30.

Batch 11 

needs me to gather up the pages csvs.
