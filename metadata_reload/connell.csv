He opened a studio in downtown Los Angeles in 1925 and became a member of the Camera Pictorialists. He taught at Art Center College in Pasadena from 1931 until his death. His work includes movie publicity shots, magazine assignments and other commercial photography. Connell photographed every industry in California at the time. He completed a number of literary projects and artistic endeavors as well. Connell is known for his use of photomontage and there are examples of this aspect of his work among the nitrate images in the form of the photomontage itself and individual images that were used in creating the montage.","[between 1928-1961]","1928/1961","","","893"
