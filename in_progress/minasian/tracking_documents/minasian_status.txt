Batches 1-9
Still working with Apps team to develop reasonable presentation of Table of Contents for Minasian items that have conceptual works.
Although the ticket for using the HTML br tag was completed, when I tried to test using both <br> and <br/> the tag was presented literally in the item view page.
Californica stage ingest is broken/stuck. Will work with Apps team to get that unstuck.

Batches 10 and 11
Bucketeering for the first manuscript in Batch 10 failed.
Assigned bucketeering for Batch 10 to Jake, with a note that the first csv was failing and that he might need help

Batch 10 is ready for bucketeering (and troubleshooting)
Batch 11 needs me to gather up the pages csvs.
