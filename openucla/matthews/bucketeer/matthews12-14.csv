In 1841 Leidesdorff settled in the Mexican village of Yerba Buena on San Francisco Bay. Over the next three years he became a successful merchant by making frequent trips between California, Mexico and Hawaii. In 1844 governor Micheltorena confirmed his land grant of 35,000 acres on the American River. Ranch Rio de Los Americanos was located near the spot where James Marshall discovered gold in January 1848. When Leidesdorff died unexpectedly in May 1848 he was buried inside Mission Dolores Church. Leidesdorff was a social, economic and political force in pre-gold rush San Francisco. When he was named the U.S. Vice Consul to Mexico in 1845, he became the nation’s first African American diplomat. He was elected to San Francisco’s first city council and its first school board in 1847. He built the first hotel, the first shipping warehouse, he operated the first steamboat on San Francisco Bay, and he laid out the first horse race track in California","","1 photograph","","","","","","spec-coll@library.ucla.edu","Early California, 1781-1920","Early Settlers Outside Los Angeles, 1800-1880","Leidesdorff, William A.

In 1844 governor Micheltorena confirmed his land grant of 35,000 acres on the American River. Ranch Rio de Los Americanos was located near the spot where James Marshall discovered gold in January 1848. When Leidesdorff died unexpectedly in May 1848 he was buried inside Mission Dolores Church. Leidesdorff was a social, economic and political force in pre-gold rush San Francisco. When he was named the U.S. Vice Consul to Mexico in 1845, he became the nation’s first African American diplomat. He was elected to San Francisco’s first city council and its first school board in 1847. He built the first hotel, the first shipping warehouse, he operated the first steamboat on San Francisco Bay, and he laid out the first horse race track in California","","1 photograph","Caption: Old City Hotel, 1846, corner of Kearny and Clay Streets, the first hotel in San Francisco.","unknown","","","","spec-coll@library.ucla.edu","Early California, 1781-1920","Early Settlers Outside Los Angeles, 1800-1880","Leidesdorff, William A.

Next he purchased seventeen and one-half adjoining this, and then ten acres in Redlands. The Redlands property was then traded for twenty acres adjoining the original purchase. Mr. Beal built a house, improved his land and was one of the leading horticulturists in his neighborhood. He married Miss Martha Embers, a native of California, and had had seven children, four of whom survived into adulthood.

Miller's primary civil rights concerns were housing discrimination, police brutality, and discriminatory hiring practices in the police and fire departments. Miller argued some of the most historic civil rights cases ever heard before the U.S. Supreme Court. He was chief counsel before the court in the 1948 decision that led to the outlawing of racial restrictive covenants. He purchased the newspaper, The California Eagle, from Charlotta Bass (1951) and he began writing for the Eagle, which earned him a reputation in the black community as an articulate and outspoken defender of African Americans. Under Loren Miller's stewardship, the California Eagle continued to press for the complete integration of African Americans in every sector of society, and to protest all forms of Jim Crow. He also contributed numerous articles to such journals as The Crisis, The Nation, and Law in Transition. Governor Edmund G.

Born in Mobile, Alabama, he was the son of a wealthy white man and a poor black woman. He graduated from Talladega College (1908), and Yale Divinity School (1911). He was the pastor of Bethel Church in Bridgeport, Connecticut, the Union Congregational Church in Newport, Rhode Island (1911 to 1913), then with the American Missionary Association (AMA) (1913-1920). After serving as a pastor in Cleveland, Kingsley went to Good Shepherd Church in Chicago (1927-1943) where he led the church in providing social welfare services and encouraging community development. Kingsley then moved to Little Tokyo in Los Angeles where he served as director of Pilgrim House (1943-1951). He arrived when nearly all of the Japanese Americans and Japanese nationals were in internment camps, was a vocal opponent of their incarceration and made strides to reintegrate the group into the community upon their return.

Born in Mobile, Alabama, he was the son of a wealthy white man and a poor black woman. He graduated from Talladega College (1908), and Yale Divinity School (1911). He was the pastor of Bethel Church in Bridgeport, Connecticut, the Union Congregational Church in Newport, Rhode Island (1911 to 1913), then with the American Missionary Association (AMA) (1913-1920). After serving as a pastor in Cleveland, Kingsley went to Good Shepherd Church in Chicago (1927-1943) where he led the church in providing social welfare services and encouraging community development. Kingsley then moved to Little Tokyo in Los Angeles where he served as director of Pilgrim House (1943-1951). He arrived when nearly all of the Japanese Americans and Japanese nationals were in internment camps, and was a vocal opponent of their incarceration and made strides to reintegrate the group into the community upon their return.  Kingsley continued to be active in California race relations for the remainder of his life and actively promoted harmonious race relations between blacks, whites, Chicano, and Japanese.+-0","","1 photograph","Photographer's stamp on back of photo: McLain's Photo Service / 24 Hour Service / 1168 East 47th Place / AD 1-9732 Los Angeles 11, Calif.","unknown","","","","spec-coll@library.ucla.edu","Prominent Individuals and Families, 1885-1980","","Du Bois, W.

Miller was appointed to the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles (1964-1967).

Miller argued some of the most historic civil rights cases ever heard before the U.S. Supreme Court. He was chief counsel before the court in the 1948 decision that led to the outlawing of racial restrictive covenants. He purchased the newspaper, The California Eagle, from Charlotta Bass (1951) and he began writing for the Eagle, which earned him a reputation in the black community as an articulate and outspoken defender of African Americans. Under Loren Miller's stewardship, the California Eagle continued to press for the complete integration of African Americans in every sector of society, and to protest all forms of Jim Crow. He also contributed numerous articles to such journals as The Crisis, The Nation, and Law in Transition. Governor Edmund G. Brown of California appointed Miller to the Superior Court (1964) of California, where he served until his death.|~|Juanita Ellsworth Miller was the Deputy Director of the Department of Social Welfare for the State of California, a chartered member of the Allied Arts League and a life member of the NAACP.
