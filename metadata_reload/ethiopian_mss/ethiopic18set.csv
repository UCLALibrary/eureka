In this manuscript Song of Song is not included.  The reason seems to be that Song of Songs is usually attached with Psalms and it becomes part of the church service book.  The manuscript also contains the books of the 12 minor prophets.  Like the other Christian traditions, the Ethiopian scholars also divided the book of the prophets of the Old Testament into two parts, Abayet Nabiyāt (major prophets) and Daqiqa Nabiyāt (minor prophets).  Critical editions and translations of parts of the Ethiopic versions of the books of Solomon and minor prophets of Ethiopic version were conducted, especially in Europe.","","failed",

There are two types of introduction.  The longer one presented in this manuscript is read every Sunday and on the feast of St. Mary. The introduction of the Miracles of St. Mary is also known as the Book of Order, which discusses how the book of the Miracles of St. Mary came to Ethiopia.  In addition to its introduction about the honor of St. Mary and her miracles and the importance of reading her miracles, the book also lists the 33 feasts of St. Mary.  Based upon the method of andmeta commentary, the author tries to comment on the introduction and points out the importance of honoring her feast and hearing the reading of the miracle.  The author also explains the severity of the anathema of the fathers on those who have not followed this order.","","failed",
