Gordon, Jr./William C. Beverly, Jr. Collection","The approximately 800 photographs in this collection represent the lifelong interest of Los Angeles African American attorney, Walter L. Gordon, in documenting little known aspects of African American history and culture through the first half the 20th century. Los Angeles and the legal profession were plagued by racial discrimination, but these photographs display a range of people, places and institutions who successfully defied society’s limited expectations. Materials include photographs given to Mr. Gordon by California Eagle newspaper publisher Charlotta Bass;  photos Mr. Gordon collected of images of black resorts such as Val Verde; well-known political figures;  sophisticated night life and social club functions; performing artists such as Count Basie, Louis Armstrong and Billie Holiday. Mr. Gordon established his law practice in 1936; he retired in 2004, after nearly seventy years practicing law. In 2002, the entire collection was given to William C. Beverly, Jr., who loaned them to Eighth & Wall (an organization promoting the preservation of the history of the African American community of Los Angeles). In 2010, the collection was donated to UCLA.

He played baseball in Japan, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico, and somehow managed to stretch out his varsity college football career over (at least) seven seasons and four different schools (Agate Type: Halley Harding, agatetype.typepad.com). He later became a sportswriter for the Los Angeles Tribune. Along with other African American journalists, he led pickets against all-white baseball teams such as the Los Angeles Angels. When the Rams moved to Los Angeles, they applied to lease the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Harding made a moving speech at the Coliseum Commission's hearing, arguing that since black tax dollars helped build and maintain the Coliseum, none of its tenants should be allowed to discriminate. He also summarized the contributions of black athletes who had played in the NFL before an unwritten color ban was instituted in 1933, and spoke of the sacrifices of African American soldiers in World War II. Rams General Manager  Charles Walsh met with Harding a week after that meeting, at the Last Word, a club on Central Avenue. Harding brought with him influential editors from all three major black weekly papers: the Los Angeles Sentinel, the California Eagle, and the Los Angeles Tribune. Harding's efforts played a key role in the Rams' later decision to sign the black football players Kenny Washington and Woody Strode.",1940/1949,[1940s?],1 photograph : b&w,California--Los Angeles,,,,,,,,,,ingested,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/iiif/2/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz0025p56n,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz0025p56n/manifest

When the Rams moved to Los Angeles, they applied to lease the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Harding made a moving speech at the Coliseum Commission's hearing, arguing that since black tax dollars helped build and maintain the Coliseum, none of its tenants should be allowed to discriminate. He also summarized the contributions of black athletes who had played in the NFL before an unwritten color ban was instituted in 1933, and spoke of the sacrifices of African American soldiers in World War II. Rams General Manager Charles Walsh met with Harding a week after that meeting, at the Last Word, a club on Central Avenue.
