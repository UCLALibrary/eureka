The selection is made for the purpose of a self-guided tour to study wahon (Japanese books) history in the early modern period when the publishing industry first flourished in Japan. The collection consists of prints and one manuscript produced in Kyōto, Ōsaka, Mount Kōya, Ise, Yokohama, and Edo (Tōkyō), Japan from 1627 to 1868 covering a time span of over 240 years and introduces various types of publication including 古活字版 [Kokatsuji-ban], 木活字版 [Mokkatsuji-ban], 銅版 [Dōban], 画帖装 [Gajōsō], 巻子本[Kansubon], 浮世草子[Ukiyozōshi], 黄表紙 [Kibyōshi], 黒本 [Kurohon], 重刻本 [Jūkoku-bon], 求板本 [Kyūbanbon], etc. Short explanations for these Japanese terms are provided in notes and descriptive fields. A hands-on workshop for graduate students using this collection was offered by Takashi Nakajima, Professor of Literature, Waseda University, at UCLA on the 13th and 20th of November, 2015. Dr. Nakajima also taught publication in the Edo period [1603-1868] at a five-day workshop on “Wahon Literacies” at UCLA and UCSB in summer of the same year. We invite you in addition to install a mobile app for self-studying hentaigana (the premodern Japanese syllabary), which was co-developed by UCLA and Waseda University and released in October 2015 (see The Hentaigana App), to optimize your study and enter the world of wahon. ","The collection comprises a selection of 23 titles from UCLA’s collection of premodern Japanese books, in 81 volumes, including three duplicate titles which demonstrate variations in coloration, provenance, or marginalia between copies.",,,,,"UCLA Library holds a fairly large collection of Japanese prints and manuscripts from the pre-modern (pre-Meiji [1868-1911]) period. They were acquired mostly through the effort of two UCLA professors. One is Richard C. Rudolph, Professor of Chinese Literature and Archaeology and Director of the Oriental Library, the precursor of today’s East Asian Library, who started a new department of Oriental Languages at UCLA in 1947. Another is Enshō Ashikaga 足利演正, Jōdo Shinshū priest from Sakai, Osaka, Professor of Japanese Language and Culture, and specialist in Japanese and Tibetan Buddhism who started the Japanese program in the Oriental Languages department in the same year. Dr. Rudolph purchased Chinese but also Japanese materials in Japan in the 1950s and 60s when he spent his sabbaticals in Kyoto, Japan, subsequent to his one-year acquisitions trip to Beijing, Chengdu, and other cities from the late fall of 1948 to the summer of 1949. Among those he acquired in Japan include over 220 Edo maps, such as Dai Nihon chōkanzu (大日本鳥瞰図), an early 19th century map of Japan by an ukiyoe artist Masayoshi Kitao (北尾政美 or 鍬形蕙斎 Keisai Kuwagata), over 400 medical books including a first 1774 edition of Kaitai shinsho (解体新書) and Inshoku yōjō kagami (飲食養生鑑. JP 43), an ichimaizuri (single-sheet ukiyoe print) by Kunisada Utagawa (歌川国貞), Hyakumanto darani (百万塔陀羅尼 or 無垢淨光經自心印陀羅尼), a dharani printed in the 8th century, and an exceptionally beautiful 1667 scroll of decorative sutra, Myōhō rengekyō (妙法蓮華経). Rev. Ashikaga acquired Buddhist books including nearly 1,000 volumes of a personal library of Shōun Toganoo (栂尾祥雲), (see the Toganoo Collection). As a library for Asian Studies at UCLA was well established, a collection of over 1,600 volumes (650 title) of Asian art books was bequeathed to the library by Mr. Julian Chapman Wright, a local art teacher, in 1978, which contained many Japanese woodblock prints from the Edo period adding a new dimension to the already rich Japanese premodern collection. Most are now stored in the Southern Regional Library Facility except the maps, medical books and ukiyoe prints, and a few selected items in the Special Collections.
