The investigation report was completed on February 22, 2011.  Mr. Salazar was a columnist for the Los Angeles Times and a news director at KMEX, Los Angeles’ pioneering Spanish-language television station. He was killed by a tear-gas canister fired by a deputy during a raid on the Silver Dollar bar in East Los Angeles. At the time, he was covering the Chicano Moratorium against the Vietnam War. This collection was donated to the UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center in August 2011 by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Following their accession, the LACSD confirmed the status of the materials as being in the public domain and approved the dissemination of these records through the UCLA Digital Library. The collection consists of the 2011 report as well as electronic copies of photographs, redacted documents, and audio recordings from the 1970 investigation.",,,https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/collections/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fzz002bqkb1
