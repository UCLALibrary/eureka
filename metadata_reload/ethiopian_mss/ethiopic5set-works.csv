The Vision of Baruch is also called The Fifth Baruch or The Ethiopic Apocalypse of Baruch, also used by the Ethiopian Jewish (Beta Israel) community.

It is based on the collection of The Sayings of the Desert Fathers.  Some modern historians reject the idea that Philoxenus authored this book and attribute it to Dadiso Qatrayas, a Nestorian monk of today's Qatar.
